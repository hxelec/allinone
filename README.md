KiCad files for BIG DECK all-in-one controller.
I would strongly recommend AGAINST going out and manufacturing this board because of the faulty reverse polarity protection circuit, which blocks reverse current, reducing reliability when the motors brake and try to return energy to the battery.
These files are only meant as a reference for people to learn from.
Thank you so much for your support :)
